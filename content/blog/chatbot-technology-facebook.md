AI (Artificial Intelligent) is some technology will rise soon. I’am not a expert in this, but I will tell you what i know about facebook chatbot.

# Facebook
This is the flow how Facebook communicate with user and bot on the other system. Facebook not have implemented the chatbot on his system but Facebook look like sync end to end communication with user, and user have ability to make own bot and sync to Facebook system.
